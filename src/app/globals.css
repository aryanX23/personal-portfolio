  Base body styles will now be primarily handled by applying Tailwind classes 
  to the <body> tag in your layout.tsx, e.g., 
  <body class="bg-background text-foreground dark:bg-dark-background dark:text-dark-foreground font-sans">
  This ensures Tailwind's dark mode variants work correctly.
*/

/* You can add other global styles or custom @apply utilities below */

/* If you still need global CSS variables for very specific cases not covered by Tailwind theme,
   you can define them here. However, prefer using Tailwind's theme directly.
   Example:
   :root {
     --custom-legacy-spacing: 1.23rem;
   }
   .dark:root {
     --custom-legacy-spacing-dark: 1.25rem;
   }

/* Ensure your base font is set up. Tailwind's preflight handles much of this,
   but you can reinforce it or set defaults if needed.
   The font-family is already set in tailwind.config.ts (theme.fontFamily.sans)
   and should be applied via a class like `font-sans` on the body.

  /* Other global body styles that are hard to achieve with utility classes can go here,

     The font-family is applied via `font-sans` class on the body in layout.tsx.
     Background and foreground colors are also applied via classes in layout.tsx.
